List of issues and open questions regarding nanohub integration:

1. How to enable copy on workspace?
* The best solution is to ssh into your workspace 
* ssh -t username@nanohub.org session
* I used my nanohub account (not the IU username) above and the associated password. This lets you copy paste like any other ssh term.
* Otherwise, there is importfile command which you need to execute as importfile zz and follow the rest.

2. Rappture progress bar text appears in runnning window-- how to avoid? How to make it more attractive? How to reduce buffering of std output? 

3. **How can we have dynamic changes in images on gui in a less brute force way?**

4. For classroom teaching, can we get a reservation on the cluster?

5. Can we get access to list of users who signed in an used the tools; and how did they sign in; detailed analytics to enable large-scale access?
6. User-experience surveys; how do we gather user feedback?
7. How does the user know that a new version has been updated? Can you automate this?

8. How to increment rappture input parameters by any value?
